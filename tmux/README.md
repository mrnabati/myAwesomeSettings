# Tmux

## Installation 

- ### Ubuntu
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install tmux
    ```

- ### MacOS
    ```bash
    brew install tmux
    ```

- ### CentOS
    With CentOS 7, you can run `yum install tmux`, but the version of tmux in repo is 1.8, it's too old. You can do the following steps to install the latest stable tmux:

    1. tmux has a library dependency on `libevent` which, of course, isnâ€™t installed by default:

        ```zsh
        wget https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/download/release-2.1.12-stable/libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz
        tar xzvf libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz
        cd libevent-2.1.12-stable
        ./configure && make
        sudo make install
        ```

    2. Extract the tar file:

        ```zsh
        wget https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/3.1b/tmux-3.1b.tar.gz
        tar xzf tmux-3.1b.tar.gz
        cd tmux-3.1b
        ```
    3. To install globally for all users:
        ```
        ./configure && make
        sudo make install
        ```
        or install locally for the current user:
        ```zsh
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local)
        make
        make install
        ```

    *Tips*:
    - During the build part, if you encounter with "libevent not found" error, you should install the libevent development package, by running the following command:

        ```zsh
        yum install libevent-devel
        ```

    - If you run with "curses not found" error, to compile the code you need the devel packages, run the following comamnd:

        ```zsh
        yum install ncurses-devel
        yum install glibc-static
        ```

# Configuration

- Copy the `.tmux.conf` and `.tmux.conf.local` files to your home directory. For more details, refer to [Oh My Tmux!](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
- To customize settings, overwrite the setting in the .tmux.conf.local file. **Do not edit the .tmux.conf file directly**.
